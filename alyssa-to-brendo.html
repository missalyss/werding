      <h3>Alyssa to Brendo</h3>
      <p>
        Brendon, I couldn't help falling in love with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I do actually mean it, I literally couldn't help but fall in love with you. I distinctly remember sitting on a bus, reading eHow articles on "How to not fall in love with someone." The articles weren't actually that bad, I think the problem was that I wasn't truly committed to the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you, Brendon. Thank you simply existing and for being exatly who you are. I love you not despite your faults, but because of them. Because the wholeness of you is what makes you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for opening your heart to me. Thank you for trusting me with your daughter, and for allowing me to be an equal parent with you. You're a wonderful father, and I've learned so much from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for allowing me to be myself. My bizarre, silly, perky, self. I feel the most like "me" when I'm with you. There's no greater feeling than being openly loved by you while I am vulnerably and unapologeticly "me". Thank you for loving me anyway. ðŸ˜‰
      </p>
      <p>
        I promise to never give up on us. I promise to do what it takes to keep us going through all the ups and downs of life. I promise to comfort you when you're suffering, and stand by you when you need me. I promise to listen to you. I promise to work on being the kind of partner you need me to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        I promise to love the children we raise, to respect them and cherish them, provide for them, and keep them safe to the best of my ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        I promise to never throw you a surprise party.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I promise to never, ever, <em>ever</em> give up on the hotdog sandwich debate.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you so much, with all my heart.
      </p>
