      <h1>Opening</h1>
      <p>
        <em>If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Humans have learned that love, connection, and community are key to flourishing. Today we honor the union of a new community, but before we do that, we must acknowledge the communities that we come from, the communities that have loved us, supported us, and have given us guidance.</p>
      <p>Brendon and Alyssa would like to personally thank each of you for the time, effort, generosity, and miles traveled that many of you have had to expend to be here today. It brings them so much joy to have the people who love them most here to celebrate this significant event: the legal bonding on Brendon and Alyssa (and Sophie. And Pizza.)</p>
      <p class="center">***</p>
      <p>Each spring, the life force of Nature is once again restored. The warmth of the sun upon the soil, awakens the life within the seed. The cycle of regeneration begins anew, and from what appeared to be death comes new life. It seems that life is not extinguished by death, but that death brings new life. This reminds us that each death is only a transition. And with every transition, we learn that we must prepare the soil of our lives. We must plant the seeds of our hopes and desires. We must nurture those seeds, care for them and protect them if we wish to reap in the coming harvest.</p>
      <p>In the case of this family, the only death is the idea of their separateness. They have known long before today that they are a family. Together, they have felt the strength of their community. They have known companionship, refuge, warmth, affection, and lots and lots of love.</p>
      <p>Today, Brendon and Alyssa (with the help of Sophie) plant new seeds. By saying "I do", they affirm the commitment they have already known, the love they have already felt, and the family they already are. Love is a powerful force, a vicious cycle, where love begets more love. And with it, this family has been able, and will be able to reap connection, joy, and more love.</p>

      <p>Alyssa, do you take Brendon to be your lawfully wedded husband?</p>
      <p>Do you promise to love him, protect him, and to make hotdog sandwiches for him?</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Rings</h1>
      <p>A ring is an unbroken circle, with ends that have been joined together, and it represents your union. It is also a symbol of wholeness, just as you two together become more whole with each other than apart. It is a symbol of infinity, and of your infinite love. It encircles an opening, which is the door to your future. When you look at these rings on your hands, be reminded of this moment, your commitment, and the love you now feel for each other.</p>
      <p>
        Brendon, place the ring on Alyssa's finger and repeat after me:
      </p>
      <p>
        Alyssa, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love with the pledge to love you today, tomorrow, always, and forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, Alyssa, place the ring on Brendon's finger and repeat after me:
      </p>
      <p>Brendon, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love with the pledge to love you today, tomorrow, always, and forever.</p>

      <h1>Closing</h1>
      <p>By the power vested in me by the state of Washington and an online reverend registration, I now pronounce you husband and wife!</p>
       <p>You may kiss.</p>
      <p>I now present to you, Mr. and Mrs. Brendon and Alyssa Helgason!</p>
