        <em>If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Humans have learned that love, connection, and community are key to flourishing. Today we honor the union of a new community, but before we do that, we must acknowledge the communities that we come from, the communities that support us, love us, and guide us.</p>
      <p>Brendon and Alyssa would like to personally thank each of you for the time, effort, generosity, and miles traveled that many of you have had to expend to be here today. It brings them so much joy to have the people who love them most here to celebrate this significant event: the legal bonding on Brendon and Alyssa (and Sophie. And Pizza.)</p>
      <br>
      <p>Each spring, the life force of Nature is once again restored. The warmth of the sun upon the soil, awakens the life within the seed. The cycle of regeneration begins anew, and from what appeared to be death comes new life. It seems that life is not extinguished by death, but that death brings new life. This reminds us that each death is only a transition. And with every transition, we learn that we must prepare the soil of our lives. We must plant the seeds of our hopes and desires. We must nurture those seeds, care for them and protect them if we wish to reap in the coming harvest.</p>
      <p>In the case of this family, the only death is the idea of their separateness. They have known long before today that they are a family. Together, they have felt the strength of their community. They have known companionship, refuge, warmth, affection, and lots and lots of love.</p>
      <p>Today, Brendon and Alyssa (with the help of Sophie) plant new seeds. By saying "I do", they affirm the commitment they have already known, the love they have already felt, and the family they already are. Love is a powerful force. And with it, this family will be able to reap </p>
      <!-- today the plant new seeds. the seed is of this family. they will pour love into it. and they will reap the rewards  -->

        <h3>Alyssa to Sophie</h3>
        <p>Hey kiddo. I'm going to use some grown-up words, so you might not understand them right now, but just listen the best you can and one day you can read what I'm about to say and remember it.
        <p>Today is a very special day, that I become your real, actual step-mom. I'm so honored to get to be your step-mom. Having you as my special kiddo fills me up with so much joy. I know, however, that being a step-mom isn't the same thing as being a mom. You and your mom have a very special relationship. I promise to do my best to help your mom be the best mom ever to you. And I promise to support your relationship with her in whatever way is appropriate.</p>
        <p>I promise to try my best to be a good step-mom to you. I promise to love you. I love you now and will love you just as much as if you were my own kiddo. I promise to protect you from things and people that are dangerous or harmful. I promise to do my best to help guide you so that one day, when you are a grown up, you can go out into the world, confident and strong.</p>
        <p>I promise to challenge you to do more and go farther than you think you can. I promise to encourage you to try things you've never tried before, while keeping good jugdment and staying safe. I promise to be truthful to you, and answer your questions. I will not hide you from the realities of existence, but I will sheild you from unnecessary ugliness. I promise to do my best to listen to you. To understand you. To empathize with you.</p>
        <p>I promise that I won't be perfect. I will get impatient and make mistakes. I will get frustrated and make bad decisions. Sometimes, my help will not be helpful. And one day, you may find some things that I believe and will have told you, are different than what you believe. You will choose your own path, and your dad and I are here to love and support you through it.</p>
        <p>I will never be one of your birth parents. Your dad and your mom are both such special people I could never replace. But I'm so joyful and grateful to get to be your Lou. Thank you for being my kiddo. I love you with all my heart.</p>

        <p>I couldn't help falling in love with you. In a time when I was alone, when it made no difference to anyone what I did or where I went, you were an island of friendship. You were someone who wanted to listen to me, and talk to me.</p>
        <p>I remember when I first talked about you. It was to my family, before my brother Emerson's wedding. I said, \"Oh you guys, my new boss is great, he thinks I'm funny.\" The truth is, I'm probably not really as funny as I am weird and silly. But that didn't seem to bother you. It seemed to surprise you and pull out characteristics that I didn't expect from your stoic face. And together, we experienced laughter and joy. Whether it was using emojis to make each other guess songs, or me winning at the month-long water drinking contest, together we took the ordinary and made it extraordinary.</p>
        <p>And besides the silliness and laughter, there was a depth too. One where we should share our past and the darkness inside us and not be ashamed. There was such freedom in talking with you. I felt like </p>
        <p>I'm not kidding when I say that I couldn't help falling in love with you. You were unavailable for several reasons and I respected that, keeping our relationship as platonic as possible. I started to refer to you as 'a really good friend' while looking up ehow articles of how to not fall in love with someone.</p>
