        <em>If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans have learned that love, connection, and belonging are key to flourishing. We achieve that love, connection, and belonging through our families and communities. Today we honor the union of a new community, a new family: Brendon, Alyssa, and Sophie. Before we do that, it is important to acknowledge the communities that they have come from: the people that have loved them, supported them, and have given them guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brendon and Alyssa would like to personally thank each of you for the time, the effort, the generosity, and the miles traveled that you all have invested to be here today. It brings them so much joy to have the people who love them most here to celebrate this significant event: the legal bonding of Brendon and Alyssa (and Sophie. And Pizza.)
      </p>

        Each spring, the life force of Nature is once again restored. The warmth of the sun upon the soil, awakens the life within the seed. The cycle of regeneration begins anew, and from what appeared to be death comes new life. It seems that life is not extinguished by death, but that death brings new life. This reminds us that each death is only a transition. And with every transition, we learn that we must prepare the soil of our lives. We must plant the seeds of our hopes and desires. We must nurture those seeds, care for them and protect them if we wish to reap in the coming harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of this family, the only death is the idea of their separateness. They have known long before today that they are a family. Together, these three have known companionship, refuge, warmth, affection, belonging, and lots and lots of love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Brendon and Alyssa (with the help of Sophie) plant new seeds. By saying "I do", they affirm the commitment they have already known, the love they have already felt, and the family they already are. Love is a powerful, exponential force. Love begets more love. It's like a <em>vicious cycle</em>, but of love. And with this love, this family has been able, and <em>will</em> be able to reap connection, joy, and more love.

      <p>Brendon and Alyssa, the vows that you make to one another today present you with the opportunity to express your love in your own words. At this time, I'd like to invite you to publically declare these vows. </p>

    <div id="rings" class="container">
      <h1>Rings</h1>
      <p>
        Sophie, will you bring the rings up here?
      </p>
      <p>
        A ring is an unbroken circle, with ends that have been joined together, and it represents your union. It is also a symbol of wholeness, just as you two become more whole together, than apart. The ring is a symbol of infinity, and of your infinite love. Whenever you look at these rings on your hands, be reminded of this moment, your commitment, and the love you now feel for each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Brendon</span>, place the ring on Alyssa's finger and repeat after me:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Alyssa, I give you this ring
        <br>
        as a symbol of my love
        <br>
        with the pledge to love you
        <br>
        today, tomorrow, always, and forever.
        <br>
        With this ring, I thee wed."
      </p>

        And now, <span class='bold'>Alyssa</span>, place the ring on Brendon's finger and repeat after me:

      <p>
        "Brendon, I give you this ring
