      <h3>Alyssa to Sophie</h3>
      <p>
        Hey kiddo. I'm going to use some grown-up words, so you might not understand them right now, but just listen the best you can and one day you can read what I'm about to say and remember it.
      <p>
        Today is a very special day, that I become your real, actual step-mom. I'm so honored to get to be your step-mom. Having you as my special kiddo fills me up with so much joy. I know, however, that being a step-mom isn't the same thing as being a mom. You and your mom have a very special relationship. I promise to do my best to help your mom be the best mom ever to you. And I promise to support your relationship with her in whatever way is appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        I promise to try my best to be a good step-mom to you. I promise to love you. I love you now and will love you just as much as if you were my own kiddo. I promise to protect you from things and people that are dangerous or harmful. I promise to do my best to help guide you so that one day, when you are a grown up, you can go out into the world, confident and strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        I promise to challenge you to do more and go farther than you think you can. I promise to encourage you to try things you've never tried before, while keeping good jugdment and staying safe. I promise to be truthful to you, and answer your questions. I will not hide you from the realities of existence, but I will sheild you from unnecessary ugliness. I promise to do my best to listen to you. To understand you. To empathize with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I promise that I won't be perfect. I will get impatient and make mistakes. I will get frustrated and make bad decisions. Sometimes, my help will not be helpful. And one day, you may find some things that I believe and will have told you, are different than what you believe. You will choose your own path, and your dad and I are here to love and support you through it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will never be one of your birth parents. Your dad and your mom are both such special people I could never replace. But I'm so joyful and grateful to get to be your Lou. Thank you for being my kiddo. I love you with all my heart.
